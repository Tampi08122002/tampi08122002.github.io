An introductory note to quantum mechanics and statistical physics.
This note was originally intended to help out students of CentraleSup√©lec in
their first year. However, it has been refined and should be accessible to any
student with some background of linear algebra and a basic comprehension of
physics (a bit of knowledge about electromagnetism should help to appreciate the
full scope of this note).

The topics tackled are the basics of quantum mechanics, starting from an
algebraic point of view and climbing our way up to the hydrogen atom, as well as
an introduction to statistical physics at equilibrium, focusing on
microcanonical and canonical ensembles.

The notes can be found in both
[French](http://tampi2002.github.io/files/notes/PhyQ.pdf) and in
[English](http://tampi2002.github.io/files/notes/QuantumPhys.pdf). The english
translation might not be perfect.
