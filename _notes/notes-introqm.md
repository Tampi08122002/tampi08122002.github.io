This extremely short note is aimed at beginner students who wish to tackle the
topic of Quantum Mechanics. It puts the emphasize on the postulate of Quantum
Mechanics and aims to draw a clear link between the formulation of Quantum
Mechanics and linear algebra. 

One should be familiar with basic linear algebra (matrix computations, vector
spaces, scalar products, ...) in order to fully grasp the scope of this few
pages. 

The postulates of quantum mechanics are formulated in a purely mathematical form
(though not overly formal). The relationship between so called *observables* and
*operators* and their *commutation relations* is particulary discussed. The
probabilistic interpretation and the relations to physical measurements are
exposed as well. 

It was written as part of a pedagogical activity in CentraleSup√©lec. I thank
deeply my coauthor Pauline Mathiot, for her endeavours and her joyful
collaboration on this project.
