An introductory note to the canonical formalism of quantum field theory. 
Quantum field theory is the most succesful theory of modern physics. In its more
advanced form it allows to account for almost every observation. It is an almost
complete model for particle physics. We are now sure that quantum field theory can't be the full story, as it doesn't
explain neutrinos masses or dark matter for instance. 

This note is only a short introduction to the topic, presenting only the most
basics techniques and reasonings that allows to buuld up the Standard Model. It
is mostly focused on theoretical aspects and does not speak too much about its
application to the Standard Model. 

This note contains some reminders about classical field theory and then dives
into the topic of quantization of fields. It only follows a canonical approach
(like the one usually used in quantum mechanics) and does not present other
more advanced methods like path integrals. To this repect it is far from
exhaustive but maybe it can be helpful to discover the topic at first. 

The notes can be found in

I'm currently working on an english translation.
