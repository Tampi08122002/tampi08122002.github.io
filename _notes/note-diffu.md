These few pages represent an example on how one can use quantum mechanics and
Fermi's golden rule to derive scattering amplitudes for certain processes.

The chosen process is the scattering of a Bloch electrons using photons. This
shall demonstrate how electromagnetism enters in the formalism of Quantum
Mechanics, and should also emphasize on the Bloch description of electrons. This
last assumpation shall help in many calculation using periodicty of the
system.

It was written for a course about light-matter interaction in CentraleSup√©lec.
