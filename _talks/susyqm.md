This very short note explains how one deals with symmetries in the canonical
formulation of Quantum Field Theory. Specifically it shows how symmetries can
give rise to conserved currents in charges. It puts the emphasize on relating
the mathmatical framework of *Lie algebras*, with what physicist call
*generators*. We prove that the conserved charges can be considered to be the
generators of the symmetry. An aside in String Theory is provided to explain how powerful and
general the mathematical setup is.
